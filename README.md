# Construction Company Database  
[Live Video Demo]()

---

## Description
This database is designed to keep records for a construction company  
to help maintain orderly, productive flow of business.  
This is a relational database that practices normalization.  
It was scripted using Microsoft SQL Server.  
There are SQL statements and queries that are included to  
test the relationships between data as well as process the data.

## Data  
There is sample data I hard-coded in order to test the SQL statements and queries.
<br>
<br>

## Queries
There are 3 SQL statements and 14 queries I wrote to process the data.  
They will all be shown in the Live Video Demo.  
Otherwise they are included as part of the whole SQL script in this repository.
