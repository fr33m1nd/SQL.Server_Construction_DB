# Construction Company Database  
[Live Video Demo]()

---

## Description
This database is designed to keep records for a construction company  
to help maintain orderly, productive flow of business.  
This is a relational database that practices normalization.  
It was scripted using Microsoft SQL Server.  
There are queries that are included to test the relationships between data  
as well as process the data.
